<Info>
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a crucial security measure for protecting your Milways.Finance account. With 2FA enabled, you'll need to enter a dynamic verification code from an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator) in addition to your password to log in or perform sensitive operations, significantly enhancing your account security. We strongly recommend all users enable 2FA.
