Make sure to select a network that matches the external wallet or exchange you're sending funds from.
4. üî¢ **Get Deposit Address**: After selecting a network (e.g., Tron network), the system will display the corresponding deposit address (in both QR code and text format). Click the **"Copy"** button below the address to copy it to your clipboard.

<Warning>
**Important Notes:**
* Make sure the network you choose **exactly matches** the network you're using to send funds. Sending funds to an incorrect network address may result in **permanent loss**.
* Each network has its own deposit address. Please carefully verify the address you've copied.
* Paste the copied address into the withdrawal page of the wallet or exchange you're transferring funds from.
* Deposits typically require some network confirmation time, please be patient.
